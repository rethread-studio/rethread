## *myriad* - open call for communities and digital art(ists) 

*myriad* is an exhibition that explores the themes of provenance, contribution and inspiration in digital artworks. It expands the notion of authorship, to explicitly unveil and credit the vast communities of coders, artists, inventors and beloved ones that contribute to artworks in the digital age. Behind all software, which permeates society and supports algorithmic art, are vast groups of people who have built layers upon layers of code written over decades. 

### The call

This call is for artists to be part of an exhibition and discussion. 

*myriad* is open to digital artists interested in letting the public grasp the world-wide networks of human labor involved in our digital society, through artworks and expert panels. 

Any artist using software as part of their practice is welcome to apply. There is no theme for the submissions, they do not need to be related to the topic of the exhibition, but the artist needs to be willing to engage with the larger conversation of the theme of the exhibition and work together with re|thread to enable the creation of the extended “credits” for their work.

This entails providing a list of the software used in the creation of the work, as well as the answering questions regarding other (artistic, technical, social, philosophical etc.) inspiration and key contributions to the work in written or interview format.

Decisions about selection will be made by the project group and cannot be appealed.

EXTENDED DEADLINE: New deadline for application: 23:59 anywhere on Earth, February 1, 2024
(-Deadline for application: 23:59 anywhere on Earth, January 8, 2024-)

Artist fee/compensation for selected artists: 17 000 SEK
Travel cost reimbursement for Swedish residents: up to 1 000 SEK (receipts required)

Travel cost reimbursement for non-Swedish residents: up to 7 000 SEK (receipts required)

### The project

The cultural and social context in which an art piece is created infuses it with another huge library of inspirations and helpful contributions, invisible in the end result. *myriad* highlights the fundamental human and collective nature of software for digital art.

The exhibition will take place from September 28 to October 13, 2024, in Stockholm, Sweden.

Six to eight artists will be invited to present one artwork each. The artwork can be original, made for the purpose of the exhibition, or can be an existing artwork. Each artwork will be presented on its own, to let the audience experience it as a work representative of the most recent techniques for artistic creation. 

Simultaneously, an art installation, made by us, re|thread, will complement these artworks to unveil the “credits”, the lists of developers that contributed to the software used in the making of the artwork, as well as the artist’s inspirations or support network. It will consist of a central sculpture and individual modules. A headphone based sound work will permeate the exhibition. If the invited artists’ works use sound, that sound will have to be incorporated into the larger work. For more information regarding this "credits" installation and sound work, please visit the dedicated page on the *myriad* website: https://rethread.art/projects/myriad/loam.html

*myriad* will engage with the following themes.

- (lack of) (discernible) authorship
- collectivity of cultural practices
- the genius and the collective
- layers and threads in creative works over time and over effort
- invisible human labor 

The selected artworks do by no means need to relate to these themes, and are in fact encouraged to be independent from them.

### About re|thread

re|thread (https://rethread.art/) is a collective of software researchers, artists, and designers, based in Stockholm (Sweden). Our work lies at the intersection between software technology, art, interaction design, sonification, and visualization, and focuses on the use of software as the material and medium for artistic creation. We organize, create and curate *myriad*.

Our work for this project is supported by [Konstnärsnämnden](https://www.konstnarsnamnden.se/), the Swedish Art Grants Committee.
