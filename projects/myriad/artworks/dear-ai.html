            <h2>by Fred Wordie</h2>

            <p>
                First launched online as an experiential piece of design fiction, <i>Dear Ai</i> explores how the proliferation and normalisation of AI tools affect traditional notions of value, effort, and meaning in personal communication and indeed, relationships. Website visitors were invited to instantly compose Birthday, Thank You, Sympathy and Love Letters, and send them via email in under two minutes.  
            </p>
            <p>
                As an installation, <i>Dear Ai</i> showcases a selection of these sent letters; Each penned using algorithmic generated handwriting and inviting us to ask whether 'I miss you' scrawled on the back of a postcard is worth more than 5000 words of AI love?
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Dear Ai</i> will be <a href="../exhibition.html">exhibited</a> between 04/10 and 12/10.
            </p>

            <h3>about the artist</h3>
            <p>
                Fred Wordie is an artist, critical designer and creative technologist, whose practice has uses provocative, playful and performative design fiction to critique and spark debate about emerging technology's impact on society. Fred's current area of research is exploring AI as a form of Techno-Solutionism and its impact on both the personal and societal level. Through a series of writings, designed artefacts and workshops he has been exploring how unimaginative technology, specifically Generative AI, is unable to resolve socio-political and economic tensions but instead reinforces normative culture, entrenches existing power structures and dehumanises us through Technomorphism.
