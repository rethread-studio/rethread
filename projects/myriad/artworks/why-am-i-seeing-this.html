                <i>Why Am I Seeing This?</i> is a video installation, using four synchronized videos powered by Raspberry Pi, explores the influence of Information, Communication, and Technologies (ICT) on human perception and reality. It examines how digital landscapes, algorithms, and personalized news feeds create "parallel information universes," isolating users within ideological bubbles. Collaborating with scientists from the European Commission, the project questions ICT's role in shaping perception, challenging traditional distinctions between object and subject. It critiques the effects of online interaction, data ownership, and the evolution of human vision in a hyperconnected era, questioning free choice and control over personal data.
