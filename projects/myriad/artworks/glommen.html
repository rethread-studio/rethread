                <i>Glommen</i> is Jonas Johansson's first personal work, created during a pivotal time after moving to Canada from Japan. While working at a leading design studio on large-scale stage experiences, he transitioned from viewing code as function to embracing it as sculpture. Inspired by his father, a painter of light, he began experimenting. <i>Glommen</i> reflects his connection to his seaside hometown and the bittersweet anticipation of life without his father. The sun's position in the artwork mirrors his birthday, near the summer solstice.

            <h3>about the artist</h3>
            <p>
                Jonas Johansson is an observer and participant in the flow and ebb of life. His work is rooted in conceptualism, revealing layers of meaning to those who look deeper. Blending physical and digital elements, his creations range from melting ice blocks with QR codes to bio couture merging silk worms with augmented reality. His art explores the interplay between the object and its function, emphasizing the delicate balance required for successâ€”too much pressure, and it breaks; too little, and it fails. Each piece challenges the viewer to engage with both the form and its purpose.
