            <p>
                Parallel to the exhibition, a symposium, <i>core and chorus</i>, on the topic of crediting and contributions in art, technology and science, was held on the 06/10/24. 
                The exhibition became the opener and ignited the spark to get a diverse group of people talking about this topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The symposium offered a platform for interested artists, technologists, scientists and others to connect and discuss the topic of systemically relevant but under-credited and underpaid work.               
            </p>

            <h3>schedule</h3>
            <p>
                - 13:00: <a href="#panel1">panel 1</a><br class="list">
                - 14:15: <a href="#panel2">panel 2</a><br class="list">

                - 17:00: <a href="#panel4">panel 4</a>
            </p>

            <h3 id="panel1">panel 1: Layers of contributions, more or less of the sum of its parts</h3>
            <p>
                How do we credit as many people as possible? What about mentors/assistants/relatives? How do we credit in the specific case of digital art (open/closed source software developers)? Can we even credit in the case of generative AI? Can we talk about crediting systems, algorithms or processes?
            </p>

            <h3 id="panel2">panel 2: What's in an artist? Art, design, game, technology, research</h3>
            <p>
                What makes it art, who identifies as an artist, what or who makes art happen in the world? Aspects of history, visions of the future and identity. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="panel3">panel 3: Maestros, muses, myth, machines and money: making art, artists and the future</h3>
            <p>
                We will talk about what the role of the artist is, has been, and will be in the future. Who gets to be the artist? Copyright and individual authorship are not ancient ideas; how might they develop? Artists need to live in society; what can we do about that?
            </p>

            <h3 id="panel4">panel 4: Collaborative work, creative processes, computational community</h3>
            <p>
                As artists, we are often encouraged to find our voice, but it is almost inevitable to, at some level, bring collaborators into your practice. In this panel we discuss different strategies of engaging with humans and machines in artistic work.
            </p>
